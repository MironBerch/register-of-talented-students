## Models

Models should take care of the data model and not much else.

Do not put any business logic in model methods (there are only a few exceptions).

## Business logic

- Store business logic in `services.py` file or in a `service/` package.
- A service can be:
  - A simple function
  - A class
  - An entire module
- Methods and functions from `services.py` files are called only with positional arguments.
- Service functions take keyword-only arguments
- Services are type-annotated
- A service does business logic - from simple model creation to complex cross-cutting concerns, to calling external services & tasks
